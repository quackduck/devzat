Where are the devs at? Devzat!

Devzat is a custom SSH server that takes you to a chat instead of a shell prompt. Because there's SSH apps on all platforms (even on phones) you can connect to Devzat on any device!

<!-- <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38882631/115499526-a4d70280-a280-11eb-8723-817f54eccf3e.png" height=400px /> -->

## Usage

Try it out:

```sh
ssh devzat.hackclub.com
```

If it's your first time logging in, you can choose your display name with the SSH username. For example, if you want to be called "wenjie", you can run:
```sh
ssh wenjie@devzat.hackclub.com
```
If you want to change your display name after the first login, you should use the `nick` command.


If you're under a firewall, you can still join on port 443:
```sh
ssh devzat.hackclub.com -p 443
```

If you add this to `~/.ssh/config`:
```ssh
Host chat
    HostName devzat.hackclub.com
```

You'll be able to join with just:
```sh
ssh chat
```

We also have a Slack bridge! If you're on the [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com) Slack, check out the `#ssh-chat-bridge` channel!

Feel free to make a [new issue](https://github.com/quackduck/devzat/issues) if something doesn't work.

See the [status site](https://stats.uptimerobot.com/kxMQqfYk4y) of the main Devzat server to check if it might be down.

### Want to host your own instance?

Quick start:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/quackduck/devzat && cd devzat
go install # or build, if you want to keep things pwd
ssh-keygen -qN '' -f devzat-sshkey # new ssh host key for the server
devzat # run! the default config is used & written automatically
```
These commands download, build, setup and run a Devzat server listening on port 2221, the default port (change by setting `$PORT`). Devzat is installed into `$GOPATH`, make sure `$GOPATH` is [added to your PATH](https://go.dev/wiki/SettingGOPATH) 

Docker start:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/quackduck/devzat && cd devzat
docker build -t devzat .
docker run -d --name devzat -p 2221:2221 -p 443:443 devzat  # Or consider using docker compose

# Start enjoying
ssh yourname@127.0.0.1 -p 2222 
```

Docker Compose:
First use:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/quackduck/devzat && cd devzat
docker build -t devzat .
```

Create a docker-compose.yml file in the appropriate location:
```yaml
---
services:
  devzat:
    image: devzat
    container_name: devzat
    environment:
      - DEVZAT_CONFIG=/etc/devzat/devzat.yml  #Create it by referring to the sample configuration file
    volumes:
      - ./devzat.yml:/etc/devzat/devzat.yml
      - ./data:/opt/devzat
    ports:
      - "2221:2221"
      - "443:443"
      #- "5555:5555" #Optional
    restart: always
```


Check out the [Admin's Manual](Admin's%20Manual.md) for complete self-host documentation!

### Permission denied?

Devzat uses public keys to identify users. If you are denied access: `foo@devzat.hackclub.com: Permission denied (publickey)` try logging in on port 443, which does not require a key, using `ssh devzat.hackclub.com -p 443`.

This error may happen because you do not have an SSH key pair. Generate one with the command `ssh-keygen` if this is the case. (you can usually check if you have a key pair by making sure a file of this form: `~/.ssh/id_*` exists)

### Help

```text
Welcome to Devzat! Devzat is chat over SSH: github.com/quackduck/devzat
Because there's SSH apps on all platforms, even on mobile, you can join from anywhere.

Run `cmds` to see a list of commands.

Interesting features:
â€¢ Rooms! Run cd to see all rooms and use cd #foo to join a new room.
â€¢ Markdown support! Tables, headers, italics and everything. Just use \n in place of newlines.
â€¢ Code syntax highlighting. Use Markdown fences to send code. Run eg-code to see an example.
â€¢ Direct messages! Send a quick DM using =user <msg> or stay in DMs by running cd @user.
â€¢ Timezone support, use tz Continent/City to set your timezone.
â€¢ Built in Tic Tac Toe and Hangman! Run tic or hang <word> to start new games.
â€¢ Emoji replacements! :rocket: => ðŸš€  (like on Slack and Discord)

For replacing newlines, I often use bulkseotools.com/add-remove-line-breaks.php.

## Integrations

When self-hosting an instance, Devzat can integrate with Slack and/or Discord to bridge messages, and Twitter to post new-user announcements.
See the [Admin's Manual](Admin's%20Manual.md) for more info.

Devzat has a plugin API you can use to integrate your own services: [documentation](plugin/README.md). Feel free to add a plugin to the main instance. Just ask for a token on the server.
